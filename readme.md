# Google Doc to Web

This was a simple project for [PLV Media](https://plv.media). We had a ~125 page guide, and preferred editing it in google docs, but wanted a more mobile-friendly browsing solution.

This is what I came up with. It's not terribly efficent, robust, or extensibleâ€”it was made to fit a purpose, and it fills its niche.

Effectively, it just parses the output from `Download -> As Web Page` and turns it into Jekyll-compatible markdown. Hosting is easy with GitHub Pages after that.

Feel free to copy, use, distribute, or otherwise use the code.
